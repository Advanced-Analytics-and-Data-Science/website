There will be four extra credit opportunities in this course.

The first two are related to the Virtual Exchange we're doing with University of Florida. More info on participation will be communicated via email.

The third one is reporting typos / errata for the course. You can do so by filling out [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYRiRHjHRDWhOuLE_6JyNA0dUNlYwSEtZOU40TVdZRUU0WjVRSjlOQ1lWOS4u). You can submit as many as you like.

The fourth, and final, one is about my cats. Undoubtedly they'll make appearances in videos, during code-alongs and workshops, and undoubtedly, I'll call out their names saying things like "Hi `[cat name]`!" or "`[Cat name]`, don't do that!". If you get the names of all four of them right, you get the extra credit. Doing so requires engaging in all course content closely.

Each extra credit opportunity is worth one percentage point on your homework average.
